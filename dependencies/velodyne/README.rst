Overview
========

Velodyne_ is a collection of ROS_ packages supporting `Velodyne high
definition 3D LIDARs`_. Test

**Warning**::

  The master branch normally contains code being tested for the next
  ROS release.  It will not always work with every previous release.

The current ``master`` branch works with ROS Kinetic, Jade, and
Indigo.  It may work with Hydro and Groovy, but that has not been
tested recently.  To build for Fuerte from source, check out the
``rosbuild`` branch instead of ``master``.
