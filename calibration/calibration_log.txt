2018-03-19        2018_03_19_ximea_to_flir_calibration.txt  ximea to flir stereo calibration
2018-03-19        2018_03_19_ximeaCalibration.txt           ximea intrinsic calibration

2018-05-02        2018_04_05_ximea_calibration.txt	        ximea intrinsic calibration. The focal length was changed.
						                                                Note the data was collected on 04-05 but processed on 05-02

2018-05-31        2018_05_31.yaml                           Redid the calibration tree based on old faro scan with
                                                            proper convention for imu and camera coordinates

2018-08-14        2018_08_14.yaml                           Tweaked the calibration from 2018-05-14 using the new lidar
                                                            to lidar calibration package. Did it quick, could be refined.
