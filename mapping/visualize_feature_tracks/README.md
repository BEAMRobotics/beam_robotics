# visualize_feature_tracks

The goal of this package is to test visual feature tracking. This package contains two nodelets: tracker and viewer. 

It was designed as two nodelets so that the user can either do the tacking and then visualize, or just visualize tracks from some other source (e.g., SLAM)
